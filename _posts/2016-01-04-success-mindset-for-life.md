# **Success mindset for life **

by Annette Khepri

When we read historically of battles and combat several thousand years ago with emotive, dramatic stories of war, assassins and Dynasties being won and lost in the East and in the forgotten ancient world, we think typically of strong, courageous, fearless and driven warriors and samurai of a bygone era with little in common with the martial arts and indeed life in the present day.

However, the practice of the martial arts has long been associated with a warrior mindset with its possible modern comparison of the 'Master' or more loosely a long serving 'Black Belt'. Collectively they are all synonymous with qualities, mental powers and abilities of what could be described as a warrior mindset and as Sun Tzu said in The Art of War; 'Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.'

The warriors' mindset skills were learned through rigorous physical, mental and spiritual practice with precise, disciplined tutelage by students fully immersed on a full time basis to learn them on every level over long periods. They were carefully carved over time and are still today not something we can just simply plug in and magically have, although they most certainly can be learned, honed and gained by choice, commitment and perseverance.

Intrinsically within the martial arts of today, there are vital characteristics, methodology and skill sets that we still use, teach and practice.

Those key aspects of a warrior's mindset can be learned from, studied and mastered over time by anyone, if you truly want to. It all starts with the decision and having the right tools, insights and guidance in place to carry the process through from start to finish. There will undoubtedly be dips and bends in the road but these all stand as markers in life's journey and provide signs, lessons and feedback as you walk along your path. Looking at these skills and teachings in a wider sense, the martial arts and warrior mindset offers a broader personal development that can be levied and applied to mainstream culture, life and business as a way of being that can be shared with everyone.

These principles have evolved, thrived and continue on today as maxims right across our history. Winston Churchill mentions key characteristics when he said: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts'.

By taking a snap shot of our modern era, we can see where, how and why ancient wisdom and its disciplines can fit in.

Many people feel stressed, overwhelmed or divided in their everyday lives as to where and how they should be spending their time and effort amidst a constant onslaught of should's, got to's, musts, never ending messages, to-do lists and responsibilities.

Modern technologies with their seemingly warp speed can sometimes make you feel as though you are never getting on top of your inbox because more is piling in by the second. This can leave you feeling that endlessly treading water feeling rather than getting ahead, or in some cases with that completely drowning in the hopelessness of it all.

In order to strengthen the mind, like the ancient masters of the East; we need to understand that as humans we are going to make 'mistakes' and it is pointless wasting our energy raking over them for the millionth time. Feedback is an alternative way to frame a mistake; it is both inevitable and just an outcome after all. The energy and meaning you attach to it, is what gives it the emotional weight that can fluctuate between something appearing to turn out amazingly well, mediocre or terribly. If you re-position your thinking and allow the feedback to simply flow through with non-attachment you are able to see the gifts, lessons and wisdom more clearly as part of the larger canvas in the Oneness of life.

'The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.' Bruce Lee

In order to get the best out of our warrior mindset, here are a few characteristics and some practical ways to help you overcome those challenges once and for all.

One of the difficulties our modern mind has over our ancestors is the absorption in one activity or another to the detriment of that which we should be doing, or in other words procrastination. Warrior Mindset Tip:Making priority lists could effectively assist you in structuring your day and enabling your mind to concentrate on the most important tasks, whilst ignoring the trivial. These should feature as concise and succinct a list as possible to clear your mind of any unnecessary distractions. Aim to write down your top 3-6 items the night before that would make the most impact on the following day. Then when you wake simply take action on those and nothing else until they are done not allowing other items to take precedence unless you are talking a life or death emergency! The actual physical practise of writing connects words to mind strongly which then allows your subconscious to start work during the night, long before you physically start.

'The Art of Mindset' starts and ends in your mind with your thoughts. Your thoughts influence your actions and your actions can often strongly indicate your results. Whilst we may have off moments and days, a warrior mindset is about taking absolute responsibility for your own mind, your own life and not giving away any of that power to anyone else. Warrior Mindset Tip: Above all else be mindful of the thoughts you are thinking and whether they are positive and moving you towards your goals or if they are negative ones and moving you away. It's also important to add that it doesn't matter about falling off the positivity train because that would be useful in its own right. A warrior mindset isn't some robotic function of an emotionless soul but rather a more deliberate, considered approach of a human being fully awake and acknowledging every single morsel of what it means to be alive in the here and now.

A strong mindset is gained through a variety of skills all sharing one common thread. Warrior Mindset Tip: thinking and results feedbackConsistency. Once you can master that aspect of your warrior mindset, everything else as they say is academic. Nothing will outlast more than the person who is simply consistently consistent. The partner of consistency is self discipline. This is born from a resolute, daily decision that over time becomes habitual. Some days are easier than others but it's important to factor in the balance element and allowing natural universal yin and yang to play out. It will undoubtedly be serving the right experience at the right time, and remember, any occasional detours will often yield their own perks.

Warrior Mindset Tip: The only way your brain will evolve and get more competent is with the use of strong self discipline. The more we stay strong and control what is being put in, the easier it becomes for us to truly 'master it' and live daily within a true warrior mindset. In reality that means doing as you say you will and definitely not displaying the 'do as I say and not as I do' mentality. These are fairly strong commands but as with all intent based suggestions, wishy-washy whims will not make the cut in the control centre of your unconscious mind. Only direct, assured and deliberate instructions need be given for if it's not heart-felt, in alignment and with a boost of truthful merit then they simply won't last and old patterns will just repeat on the minds film loop.

An example would be via the physical aspect of the arts or other sports and pursuits which are an excellent way most people learn these qualities first hand over time but it should be remembered that it is required across the board and is an essential element of a strong mindset:

'Be master of mind rather than mastered by mind.' Zen Saying

Most of us have had disappointments, or so-called failures of one sort or another. Warrior Mindset Tip: Actually these failures, which are simply feedback, are all vital research that as individuals we might like to positively receive for their lessons will be useful.

Within the Law of Attraction this process if often called a clarity list, which is ascertaining what you do want by going through the list of what you don't want or rather more accurately contrasting that which you do like by that which you dislike. By being clear on the things we both like and dislike, we are assisting our minds in becoming even clearer and focused. The more we apply this the easier it gets, so begin clearing the mind clutter immediately and getting rid of outdated thoughts that don't belong there and do not serve you.

You may also want to consider that in subconscious terms that any negative 'no' statements are interpreted as 'yes' statements, so for example, if you were to say "I don't want to read that right now" then in actual fact you will find yourself inexplicably drawn to reading that right now, as the, 'don't' or 'no' more negative aspect has been dropped by the sub-conscious and turned in to the positive statement of "I do want to read that right now". Our phrasing then, is of paramount importance when setting any powerful intent in our minds. So in our example it would be faster to say "I will read that this evening", for it will then get deposited and actioned in that context. An easy way to do this is to think in clear, succinct and concise statements of what you are actually planning and going to do. You can experiment with that idea and see for yourself.

Warrior Mindset Tip: Another great analogy is 'gardening of the mind', to simply demonstrate that the pruning of our thoughts, stories and paradigms is required on a regular basis to cut away the weeds and debris and allow room for the planting and nurturing of new seeds. A warrior mindset simply has no room for nonsense, outdated information and anything that is not allowing the mind to run at optimal performance and whilst that may not always be the easiest thing in the world to accomplish it is a task that we should attempt to pursue with some verve.

In order to control our minds and enable it to focus on what we want, it will require acknowledging the difference between the 'conscious' mind and 'subconscious' mind. We can view it like this, our conscious mind is good at making a list and viewing the items on the list but can often times be pretty lame when it comes to completing the list because it will get distracted. It goes off in tangents and sees shiny objects aka distractions and other things to amuse it such as people to talk to, things to do and places it would rather have you be.

To truly live the way of the enlightened warrior we should strive to accept and absorb whilst taking action on its teachings every day with ongoing dedication and purpose.

Each morning making a conscious decision, that will over time ultimately become unconscious, to draw a line in the sand of what was and walk forwards towards what can be today in the here and now.

Look to being mindful and present whilst cultivating your ongoing spiritual, mental and physical development as you go. Choose one focus per day or per week and allow those insights to wrap around your thinking and being. Notice how they feel, paying attention to your thoughts and what they are, whilst simultaneously allowing them to flow freely so the meanings you'd normally give them have no attachment and therefore cannot take you off course in your mindset.

Your mind is the bridge between your soulful self and physical expression and remember it is not always easy, straight forward or fast. Henry Ford was notorious for his expansive thinking and said: 'When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.'

Choose with care and poise what's coming in to your mind whilst deliberately taking notice of what needs sifting and sorting; as what you decide to focus your attention on is generally where your energy goes.
