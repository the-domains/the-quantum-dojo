Welcome to part two where we are continuing on from the last article where we delved in to the world of the enlightened warrior mindset and explored some of the mindsets tips and insights that you can use daily as part of your ongoing development in success mindset.

If you have been practicing any of the Warrior Mindset Tips from part one, you may have noticed some interesting patterns, behaviours or occurrences happening around you.Often when you are becoming more conscious of how you think, of how your thoughts affect your whole being and how emotions can take hold and literally make or break a day, shifts in your mindset will start to happen. Sometimes this can be fairly easy and being mindful is a simple thing. However, this isn't always the case, the mind can throw up and out at you an explosion of excuses, various reasons and validations for it's behaviour, thoughts and why you should or shouldn't be thinking or doing something in particular. This is more commonly known as resistance and can be accompanied with denial and sometimes along for the ride self-sabotage or any combination of non-serving and not really useful counterparts. Are they really as bad as we are led to believe or are they simply more lashings of contrast standing out for us to view and deal with if we choose to?

The more you delve into warrior mindset maxims, traits, beliefs and characteristics, the more complex it can appear. After all, when dealing with human psychology and behaviour, it is not simply a case of one size fits all. Each mind is as unique as its owner filled with history, experiences, thoughts and ideas. All completely wound up and bound into a personality, a soul and a human expression. Once this understanding is coupled with purpose and a passionate mission, then the enlightened warrior mindset really starts to unleash it's magic as Bob Proctor explains: 'When you really want something, and you couple that with an understanding of your nature, of your spiritual being, and the laws that govern you, you will keep going, regardless of what's happened. Nothing will stop you.' Let's continue on the journey and discover more along the path to living your best ever version of holistic mind, body and soul harmony through the wisdom of the warrior ways.

Warrior Mindset Tip: Your sub-conscious mind is perfect for completing tasks which have been absorbed into it through audio, visual or kinesthetic medium. In the subconscious mind it cannot tell the difference between real or not real, so one example of this would be a student saying 'I will earn my Black Belt' and a student saying 'this is too difficult, I can't do it', another example would be someone predicting 'this business will never run smoothly' versus 'this business is growing from strength to strength'. In both cases, they are right because the sub-conscious brain will yield to what is being put in there especially if it is emotive enough, believed and accompanied by repetition of thought. For each time it is run again, dwelled upon or believed, it will be creating new and repeated pathways in the brain that will ultimately take hold and actually become how it is. In other words, your thoughts will create your reality when they are repetitively thought, believed and emotively felt within your physical body.

Conversely, if you utilise that format for a specific positive outcome which is introduced into the sub-conscious, especially when you are open-hearted and feeling at high vibrational levels of inner peace and happiness, this will take hold and over time will create the same pathway or if needs be replace an outdated one.

Once your mind is stretched and reshaped, it won't ever go back to its former dimensions. Warrior Mindset Tip: A great daily practice is to read personal development or constructive material for at least a half an hour a day. Being mindful of the material you are viewing, consuming and discussing, just like when considering what types of food best serve your body, seek out those nutrients that replenish, nurture and encourage healthy growth. This habit continually feeds the mind new ideas, perspectives or reinforces previous lessons and solidifies knowledge and wisdom even further. It's also an excellent motivation tool and helps keep you focused on your own minds development which highlights the popular phrase 'the mother of all skill is repetition'.

Equally as important in all of the input and action taking in terms of cultivating your warrior mindset is the balanced yin aspect of quietening the mind also known as the 'monkey mind chatter'. If you find yourself in a very output focused busy period with a lot going on, it is really important to balance this with non-doing. Warrior Mindset Tip: Meditation is essential for a strong enlightened warrior mindset, there are times when it simply needs to be still. So everyday make some space to dissolve into absolutely nothing. This particular aspect can also be split into further sub-categories as you might like to include general pondering, reflecting and day-dreaming types of relaxed, mind wondering and non task focused aspects, along with the more deeply meditative time spent within the silent void.

When compiling comprehensive traits of a warrior mindset they often begin as Carl von Clausewitz mentions: 'Courage, above all things, is the first quality of a warrior.'This can be further expanded to include other qualities such as strength, indomitable spirit, perseverance, fearlessness, endurance, dedication, clarity and focus. Along with boldness, commitment, purpose, consistency, spirituality, egolessness, open-minded and compassionate. It can also include being brave, open-hearted, selfless, risk-taking, confidence, creativity and trust. With additional elements such as passion, action, communication, vision, strategy and charisma. Whilst quite a long list, you could create your own and add other characteristics of warrior mindset traits as each set is as unique as its owner and some will resonate more whilst others will be more poignant. Your list might have common features but you will need to shape them to your own specification so that they fuel, inspire and encourage you as you walk your path through every area of your life.

meditating by the waterBe mindful that your mindset, and especially when viewed holistically, is dependent on your ability to acknowledge the gradual improvement in all of its aspects, and not one over the other. The way you divide the trio up is up to you, but for ease, keeping a diary, a journal or an i-phone app as a memory jogger is a fail safe way to assist you. For guidance, when traversing the trinity you can use the magic three as a divisible number and split your focus between mind, body and soul into three parts of study, action and growth on the yang side and flow, non-doing and surrender on the yin side.

An enlightened warrior mindset is not about being single minded or belligerent; it is a phrase that conjures up someone's spirit and purpose. It is synonymous with those that spend time and effort on their mental development and are committed to ongoing learning. They are consistent and persistent; possess immeasurable wells of indomitable spirit and know no bounds because they know there are none. When looking at Universal Laws such as Cause and Effect and the Law of Attraction, the emphasis is biased on what begins and ends in the mind. It would be unfathomable then to expect a particular result or experience in life whilst running a negative mindset, paradigm or story. Whilst they exist in most of us in some form or other, you get to choose consciously your thoughts and remove those that are non-serving through deliberate effort. Or at least allow those thoughts to consciously flow through and past with non-attachment or judgment.

You are a living, breathing and walking library of knowledge that has infinite wisdom either at your fingertips or through intuitive guidance from Spirit.

The greater the depths of your understanding of Self and the more connected you are to Source, then the more adept you will be at handling challenges, overcoming obstacles and keeping yourself at optimal levels of happiness. In very simplistic terms it just begins with the confidence of being happy in the moment with everything else being a bonus, regardless of whether you later label those experiences as good or bad, boring or exciting they are simply life providing you with great contrast.

'There are no contests in the Art of Peace. A true warrior is invincible because he or she contests with nothing. Defeat means to defeat the mind of contention that we harbour within.'

Morihei Ueshiba

It is not readily obvious at times that the holistic aspects of the martial arts, their lessons, wisdom, skills and knowledge can be taken out of the dojo into daily life, creativity and business. But history shows us that actually, by evolving and cultivating your own enlightened warrior mindset and leading by example, you are deeply demonstrating your own art with truth and humility, reverence and grace. You can do tremendous things in your own life, for others and the wider world community by being the living embodiment of what it traditionally stands for which is echoed by Bruce Lee's philosophy: 'Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth. To me, the function and duty of a quality human being is the sincere and honest development of one's potential.'

To give the gift of your balanced and aligned mental, physical and soulful best self to both yourself and others can only be heightened by being mindfully present in the here and now. This aspect of self and your holistic ongoing growth can only be sought, obtained or simply lived in this current time frame.

Your past has led you perfectly to this point and the future is yet to unfurl and unfold, all based on where your current thinking is at.

You are either giving it your best shot or you are not, you are either present in mind or distracted, you are eitherAn ornate clock with the words Time for Change on its face doing your training, working or other tasks or you don't for one reason or another. There is nothing mysterious about an enlightened warrior mindset and there is nothing that any one person is born with to the detriment of another. It is something that we each individually choose to make a part of our total selves or not.

The power of, within and with-out of our minds is truly astonishing. If we repetitively and thoughtfully put in some daily effort, practise and inspired cultivation on what is going in, coming out, how we feel, how things affect us, whether it's positive or not and so on, you can often times see immediate improvement to your day, your life and your world.

It is useful to have these maxims as a framework that provides a holistic road map for the ongoing journey of your life and every facet of it. They serve as friends that you can lean in and lean on in times when you need them. You can refer to their wisdom for guidance and you can live with full trust of all the enlightened warriors that have walked the path before you, those that are walking it with you and also for the next generation who will be looking to you and your legacy for support, teachings and leadership.

Once you take a wider more aerial view both historically, current and future tense, you can feel a sense of deep gratitude for all that was, a reverence for all that is and a humbled standpoint for what is yet to come. The mind is absolutely one of our most amazing gifts that we get to use, explore and expand upon every day throughout our lives but it does require your constant nurturing, attention, direction and discipline to help you be your most dazzling version of who you came here to be.

Whilst weaving your own daily way of working with the wisdom of the enlightened warrior mindset, you are able to get creative with it, work out which traits and maxims align with your core being and values, along with using your discipline and indomitable will when you know you are diverting in a non-serving way.

Your own path is yours to walk however you wish, and its fine balance of yin and yang will be effervescently adding zest and vigour to your choices, decisions and opportunities. This maxim outlined by Paolo Coelho is a very useful notion to remember: 'The two worst strategic mistakes to make are acting prematurely and letting an opportunity slip; to avoid this, the warrior treats each situation as if it were unique and never resorts to formula, recipes or other people's opinions.'

Always walk in your own truth, in alignment of who you are and use your enlightened warrior mindset to help give you the strength and courage to shine your very brightest message. Live with curious and child-like wonder and to keep on going, no matter what curveballs, interesting detours or challenges the Universe may bring you. You have the tools, wisdom and insights within and your journey is perfectly unfolding every step of the way, so enjoy it!
