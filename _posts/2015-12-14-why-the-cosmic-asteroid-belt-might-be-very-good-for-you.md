# Why the Cosmic Asteroid Belt might be very good for you...!

Have you ever had a moment where you've 
thought: 'you've got to be joking' or maybe you've considered 'why me, 
why today?' or perhaps you view other people and think everything looks 
straight forward and much easier in their lives so why is it not like 
that in yours?

Whatever the litany of thoughts that 
might have bounced around the bustling centre of your mind one thing is 
most likely for sure and that is, if you could opt for a smooth, easy, 
blissfully happy and perfect existence, do you think that for one moment
you might snap it up in a heartbeat and say a big fat emphatic yes!

Ravishing reality is rather different 
though, isn't it? Days come popping up with happy regularity and with 
their puppy dog eyes full of amazing and captivating opportunities, 
possibilities and delights. Yet somehow, some way, a cheeky chancer 
shows up and throws a few pebbles under your feet, whilst you might 
falter you don't fall, so you correct yourself, possibly say a few 
choice words but you continue on your merry way. All good until an 
obstinate obstacle interjects at some inconvenient moment, quite often 
quickly followed by a barrage of things-to-do that you'd 
rather-they-didn't have to appear right now.

Soon we are finding ourselves falling 
down an avalanche of an attitude crisis, accompanied by a soprano's song
filled with drama and downfall and all kinds of things that really 
weren't how this day was supposed to be going.

And then what? How on Earth are you 
meant to recover from that? Curious conversations and endless emails, 
dodging the curveballs that seem to you, that the Universe is currently 
having a really good giggle at your expense on. What is the next plan of
attack then monsieur clever mind the centre of your helm?

If we step back and pan outwards for a 
moment and maybe we can factor is some mindful and deliberate 
intentions, this might have you thinking that, this would have ensured 
those things didn't happen. You could begin the day meditating, you 
could be ultra-mindful, you could have set very powerful intents and you
could be practically floating around on your Angel wings quite happily 
with no expectation that anything other than a perfect day was headed 
your way.

Often, these amazing tools, guided and 
inspired action and a very conscious positive daily living practise will
undoubtedly yield some magnificent moments of beautiful blissful days 
and experiences.

So what about the chaos day then, what 
was that all about and does it mean you have fallen off the conscious 
boat, does it mean that all is lost and was a waste of time and it just 
doesn't work for you?

This is either going to be a real relief
to hear or it might be a little annoying to find out.  However, we will
be bold and continue along the conscious path for it does take some 
resolute belief and continued persistence to fully live and breathe it.

Have you ever just considered why these 
things are happening? Did you ever wonder what you indeed did invite, 
attract or agree to? It could be that you chose to learn a particular 
lesson, figure something out specifically or perhaps it was really about
feeling the contrast and pushing your limits so you could actually 
reach inside to pull out that bit of resolve, creativity or even 
possibly to change your mind altogether.

Sometimes on the way to breaking through
to another level of personal growth and transformation there are some 
vital elements that could, just need and possible have to occur first. 
Let's go through these and then explore why being in both sides of the 
different holistic and conscious states will either facilitate or block 
the flow of this inner work and outer manifestation.

Whether it is intentional and deliberate
or just plain random and unconsidered, each morning our whole being 
will be operating at a particular vibration, whilst our mindset will be 
set at a level we have consciously intended or maybe just landed on that
day. If this was very mindful and conscious we will have a certain 
level of acceptance and also of non-attachment. If it was rather more 
take it as you find it, we might more readily accept any chaos heading 
our way for thinking it was due to a lack of preconceived preparation of
the day.

When a series of annoyances, grievances,
challenges, hurdles or obstacles arise set against the backdrop of the 
two very different ways of being, you might start to think will almost 
guarantee the outcome, so let's walk through them some more.

You woke up and were in a hurry, your 
meditation was the first thing to be discarded for their simply was no 
time. Your intent setting and mindfulness had to be side-stepped as 
there was just so much to do. You weren't able to eat as healthily as 
you liked that day and you most certainly couldn't fit the exercise and 
the fresh air in, that's for sure. The day seems to steam train away 
from you at lightning pace and you just couldn't seem to catch your 
breath, let alone catch up. It seemed the most sensible thing to do, in 
your logical mind was to simply say forget it, let's just say that today
was one of those days and just let it go. You simply cannot seem to 
find the energy or inclination to fight with it and do anything about it
so you just reside yourself to going with the flow of it all and you do
not have any positive expectation, or expectations of any sort for that
matter, you just get on with it the best you can.

Once the day has ended and you've 
finally stopped to relax and can reflect on the day, you start to see 
how it was not actually that bad after all. In fact, quite a few 
positive things happened and showed up. And actually overall this was a 
really great day and you are feeling really quite happy. It then 
descends upon you, you have an 'aha' moment and you realise why. You let
go. You detached. You separated yourself from outcome and accepted what
was happening and more than that, you embraced it and didn't go against
the flow it. By doing what you did, you self-adjusted and regulated the
vibrational oceans and surfed them like a pro. Consider if you had 
continued with the way the day had started and that you had held tight 
and inwards the annoyances, the frustrations, the disappointments what 
would you have attracted then? Yes, more of the same. At absolutely 
anytime on the clock you have a choice, to tighten the grip some more or
just release it and let it fall away.

Let's traverse the complete opposite. 
Today is an awesome day because you have decided it's going to be. 
You've done everything you wanted to do, you've meditated, have clear 
intentions set, you're rested, you've eaten super healthily, you are in 
complete alignment, your firing on all cylinders of the cosmic super 
highway and off you go with a dazzlingly happy smile and infectious 
positive attitude to boot. Fantastic, go you! Oh, a little hiccup 
occurred, well that's OK, you've got it covered, it's all good. Mm but 
here's another little teaser to test you, no that's fine, all sorted 
that one. How about this bigger hurdle, OK you're starting to wonder 
what's going on now. Gosh, this one is a bit of curveball and actually 
can you just catch this one low side whilst you are at it. At this 
precise point one of two things is going to happen. One you are going to
start wondering what on Earth is going on seriously this shouldn't be 
happening right? You had this down and covered so why is all this 
'stuff' occurring?

Alternatively you can take the viewpoint
of giving much gratitude and reverence for both the fact you are 
feeling amazing today and that you are being given some great things to 
handle for they must mean something significant. And that could look 
like one of a few options that maybe something like this. First off, it 
could the absolute perfect moment to deliver a life changing piece of 
universal wisdom. It might be that synchronicity popped over and it was 
about time to be shown a few more signs along your path. It could also 
mean something that you have never even considered before which can be 
highlighted in two different ways. That when you are in that great 
feeling state we have just created, you could think, assume or presume 
that this makes you impervious to anything other than 'amazing' 
happening that day. Alternatively, actually the opposite, this 
particular intent focused, inspired action version of you, is rolling 
over way to much in to yang territory. Over in yang land, yin is trying 
to politely knock and show you something quite possibly super Divine but
you are not listening, you have zero clue that she is even there. The 
thing is, right now, it's very important that these messages and signs 
get through. In fact it's of your soul's sole purpose that you really 
need to hear, see, learn, feel or witness something.

So maybe, the first few things that 
happened earlier that day were there to get your attention, the more 
they are coming in and the more you are mindfully paying attention, then
you are continually, calmly and creatively taking it all in your Zen 
stride, you are just literally doing the whole roll with punches thing 
and you are smiling, moving forwards and staying on track with the whole
ease, flow and joy mantra. You acknowledge, you are conscious, you are 
awake and paying attention and you are yielding the harder edges to make
way for the softer lines to move on through. You are essentially being 
given a bit of tough love from the Universe, this softening up process, 
is by way of a cajoling, pushing and pulling of the physical realms to 
make way for something significant, patiently waiting at the sides to 
make an appearance.

If you do not take it personally and 
take it more in the mind of Oneness, you will quickly realise that it is
completely for your own greater good. The softening up process was 
essential at that point else you might have missed the grand finale and 
this was just far too important for you to miss. It was absolutely 
essential for you to be there, in the right space and time, oscillating 
at just the right frequency in order for everything to be delivered 
perfectly and in the way that is going to create the most benevolent 
harmony for all and that is starting with you.

Sometimes that simply means that too 
much yang needs to be tempered with a bit more yin and conversely that 
if immersed in a lot of yin then a good healthy peppering of yang may be
required. The issue can arise on the physical planes, in that we can be
mindful and consciously on a particular path but if we don't notice it,
the actual path can and of itself become the very obstacle that we 
think we are not encountering. This is usually an acutely focused world 
lens that is filtering out some really useful, important or highly 
relevant synchronistic happenings, insights or glaring suggestions.

It is an ongoing balancing act but 
sometimes that which we perceive as some kind of hostile cosmic asteroid
belt, is actually the calm reassuring hand of friendship, offering 
support, guidance and a neutral space to grow and evolve or even just to
say it's all OK, just stop for a second and take it all in. This is 
where you are right now, this is the journey and the life you have 
experienced up to now and this is the cross-road, juncture and super 
highway full of irresistible choices and tantalising quests of 
discovery. As your friend, the Universe within you, is lovingly showing 
you the Way that you are choosing your without and in that pledge of 
being there for you, sometimes I, as in you, am going to have to jostle 
you around a bit just to get your attention, OK?

When we view the turbulence from a 
different perspective, when we change our choice of diction we 
irrefutably find that everything changes. What we thought was a real 
pain becomes a real blissful joy, what we imagined was a complete 
nightmare waiting to happen was a gift of the future we had previously 
been unable to see and often times even grander than we had previously 
dreamed up for ourselves.

The cosmic super highways are sprinkled 
with love, joy and bliss and they are intermittently going to run in to 
some storms of the asteroid belt variety. Any of which are neither good 
nor bad in and of themselves, they are merely only whatever we both 
label them with and the emotions we choose and can by conscious decision
unchoose to attach to them at any point in time.

So next time your day is flowing one way
or another, just smile and be very well assured that your own 
particular version of the cosmic highway of life, is your own choice and
creation and that it will be a rainbow of the elements all working 
together to create the most beautiful mosaic of life conducive to you 
having the best experience and expression that you came here to have.

Sit back, fasten your cosmic seatbelt and completely and fully immerse yourself in the ultimate ride.
