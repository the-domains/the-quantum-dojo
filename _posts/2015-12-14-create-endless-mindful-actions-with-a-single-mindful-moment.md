# Create Endless Mindful Actions with a Single Mindful Moment

Are you busy today? Is there a lot to do, or things you should be doing? Perhaps you might be on holiday right now or even taking a day off and just meandering through taking it easy.

How likely is it that for most of us, we just 'plough' through the day? Generally because we have to be here and there, get this done and that,

we have so much to think about, people to talk to, reply to, endless lists of things at home or work and our families and friends. Frazzled is probably an understatement isn't it?

Sometimes you find yourself suspended in a deep sea of overwhelm that you can't even begin to work out how on Earth you will get out of it.

For many people that yang style of living becomes just that,an ever present quite oppressive energy, almost siphoning off your core chi energy second by second. The evermore onslaught of pressure, responsibilities, commitments, should's, have to's and so on.

But what about when you stop? When you take a big deep breath... what happens then? Do you feel instantly better and relieved? If so, for how long does this last? Maybe you are very careful to balance out all of your yang action time with some inner yin work. Perhaps you find time to be in nature, you have a healthy lifestyle and feed yourself wonderful nutrition and take plenty of rest.

First, we must do our own personal work, then, we can tend the necessary work of our family, then our community, then the world." -- Lao-tzu

You know something...? It probably won't be very popular but here it goes...

It's all down to you! You chose this. It's your conscious creation or intention.

How did that feel? You might be internally explaining how you have responsibilities, jobs to do, families to look after and so on. So how can this possibly be 'my fault'?

How about it if we spin it the other way? What if we say, no of course this isn't down to you, it's nothing to do with you or maybe it's all of them, the others it's their fault, or on a wider level it's all in the hands of the Universe and you have no control or say in any of it. Does that make it sound better or worse?

If you allow anyone or anything to seemingly have any form of 'control' over you, then surely this is not really living your life or indeed in a conscious living way at all?

So let's back up to the first statement and take full responsibility to begin with because only with true ownership of the present, the circumstances or situation can you fully start to be able to make changes, alterations or remove them completely.

If we breathe it all in and say this is my choice, it's my conscious creation and breathe out, it's all simply perfect and just allow that energy to flow in and flow out. This is extremely crucial because what gets most of us, most of the time, is the part where we simply hold on. We hang on in there for dear life itself and take complete and full ownership, responsibility and joyful glee in the very essence that we are not happy with. We seem to stick to it like some kind of cosmic super glue and completely entrench ourselves in the very fibres of the things we dislike the most.

When we pluck it apart and stop, it simply makes no sense, yet we do it all the same. So the question then becomes, is there an alternative? And our solution is to change that particular track, in fact, throw it out completely, especially when you recognise it's damaging implications to your overall holistic health, it simply becomes part of the rubbish pile and not taking up a throne in your mind that it currently may habit.

Learning to live is learning to let go." -- Sogyal Rinpoche

In order to change it for something far more abundantly gracious and invigorating we need to explore the art in the mindful moment a little. It's an extremely tactile balance between the separation from what existed just now and the possibilities of what might occur in the second after. It is pretty much the space in between, the void, the moment on film where we see a slow motion event occurring frame by frame. When we consider the space we might notice it most by its absence, maybe not always but certainly for a large part of our busy days. It's simply become extinct. It is not given any permission whatsoever to live and occur naturally, it has for the illustration we are exploring, been eradicated.

Does this really matter? Especially given the amount of things we have to do in a day. Surely it's worth the sacrifice of those extra full space sacrifices just to cram in some more stuff? That's worth the exchange isn't it? If you take a look around our Earth right now, how would you answer that? Let's go with the answer that it isn't really working and on the basis of stress, illness, overwhelm , overload, obesity, addictions, suicides, wars, famine and pretty much every other social and planetary 'issue' you could muster up off the top of your head.

Is it a stretch to far to be weighing all this simply on a little lost space? Maybe or maybe not, if we delve further on you can conclude your own answer.

Let's paint a little picture and in it we are still the same busy people but we have taken full ownership of ourselves and our world and that is the totality of within and without. The seamlessness between you, I, we and the Universe, complete Oneness. We live in gratitude and reverence and actually do emit and vibrate in the frequencies of Love and Light and not just the writing of it in some meaningless attempt of pretending we are. We meditate and we breathe, we are conscious and we are mindful. We live in and of compassion, harmony and peace. We support each other; we live without any dysfunctional paradigms, stories or tragedies. We simply are.

Each day is joyfully lived out in a series of mindful moments, perfectly punctuated by the idyllic intersperses of pure space. This in turn boosts our immunity and intuition for we are operating at our most vibrant equilibrium and not being constantly thrown off and out of our own unique alignment. Our imagination is fired up and our innovation is flowing magnificently.

You take a moment to reflect upon your demands of the day and eventually you get so wonderfully good at this, you can expand into the week, month and year. First of all though, we must decide to make some possibly uncomfortable decisions with ourselves first.

That is what are we prepared to do and not prepared to do?

What can we delegate or remove?

What can we share?

What can we ask for help with?

Where our boundaries lie?

What is acceptable and unacceptable?

How we want to live our lives by our own design and not someone else's?

You can draw up your own personal list to reflect upon and mindfully action later on.

A limited mind cannot think freely." -- Bruce Lee

We need to draw up the boundaries and guides all based around our core values. It's completely natural that sometimes we might need to go back to the drawing board, we might need that extra deliberation time, and it is likely we are to be challenged at times.

But if we can find our patch of where we are with our values and beliefs are grounded then we can draw some lines and we know when we are choosing to cross them or when we are coerced, corned or commanded to and at those times we can say no.

Each day we can look to the next day and the likely demands, tasks and to do items and we can in advance sift, sort and share if needs be. We can establish what we are willing to do and what we are not. We can inform people that we will or will not be able to do a particular task after all and we can enter in to discussions with those around us to try and facilitate a better outcome for all.

A mindful moment can be magical if used wisely. We can take mindful action on those things we are committed to seeing through and remove everything else we are not. It is better serving to both others and ourselves. And when we operate out of our inner integrity and intuition we can far easier and quicker find that place of balance and happiness.

We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves." -- Buddha

So take that mindful moment now and in a flash you will be able to clear the clutter and instinctively arrange your day so you can obtain the best from it and yourself too. You will also find it can sweep across others as its motivational, practical and people can see and feel both the results and difference that the balance of mindful calm and mindful action can bring.
