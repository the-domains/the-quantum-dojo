**'Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your vision is your promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall one day unveil' James Allen**

Vision is perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects to explore and create within the human mind in our quest for development of the Self. There maybe be billions of us on Earth but as unique individuals no two visions will be identical occurring at precisely the same moment and that makes them truly exciting, astounding and completely limitless.

If we picture the world with everyone living their vision and working co-operatively in harmony, love and peace, we can most definitely see a much brighter future, one that would truly be a beautiful gift for our children. Some people might argue we should think realistically and face the world as it presently is, but doesn't the news cover that? We hear of the doom and gloom every hour on the hour, even endlessly 24/7 if you want it. Then there are the newspapers and the entire deluge of on-line news, bulletins and people's daily gossiping of this and that. Tiring isn't it? Does it speak the Truth? Probably not...

It's very wise to leave that media illusion well alone and concentrate our greatest efforts on expressing our true purpose within this lifetime on Earth. By actively and emotively creating your own magnificent vision, you get to craft, carve and continue along your very special path punctuated by the auspicious, audacious and amazing experiences, people and events that are set to be found and discovered along it.

The key is not only to remember but really live out and breathe in, in a big way so that you are at the helm. Whatever was yesterday is passed and what might become tomorrow is still up for alteration. In the mindful moment of the here and now, this is what exists on the planes of your journey. It is in this particular seemingly minuscule second, that you get to tip the balance, trigger the start gun and unleash a whole new direction. Within your mind is the capacity to let go, to cease the monkey mind chatter, to disengage with the nonsense and to really breathe deeply and consciously and evolve towards, that, which your Soul is showing you as the true path of Self. 

Our spiritual connection to the Oneness of the Universe is often times acknowledged on the one hand and then shaken off on the other. Once we disappear back in to the paradigms that are flavour of the month right now in our day to day lives; the dramas playing out, the people off-loading, difficulties arising at work or home or maybe everywhere you look. Until we truly merge these and understand that it is all one and the same, we can never be truly committed or have purity within the expression of our visions for we will always be distracted and disconnected.

Once we embrace the collective consciousness and understand that our personal vision is of the up-most exceptional importance, we may then start to sever the addiction ties to what our minds have gotten themselves caught up in to. It's not to lay blame or judgement, it's simply to see it for what it is, and let it float on by and to make way for the more exciting and enigmatic ideas that are waiting in the wings to get their chance to shine through you.

Your Soul will speak the Truth of Self and will guide you gracefully with love through your Heart that speaks to you when you intuitively 'get it' but can't quite work out how to get it. The input from your unattached and mindfully calm Mind can do the most tantalizing feats of dream engineering ever imagined for it is capable of such phenomenal acts, especially when it is dismissed from anything mundane, draining or non-serving. Your vehicle of movement of experience of all the senses, your Body, will sing out in harmony and health and will be only too willing to provide you with whatever you need to keep on going as long as it takes to fulfill your vision and destiny.

"We all have possibilities we don't know about. We can do things we don't even dream we can do." Dale Carnegie

When you view this in the wrong order or when something is array you get to see what it actually looks like out there and in here throughout society simultaneously. We see disease, obesity, illness of body and mind. We live through wars and devastation across our globe and we see some of our children orphaned, starving and helpless. We bear witness to the destruction of our Earth, its animals and forestation. This is the mirror; this is when individually we are not connected to each other and the greater good of humanity. This is where we can painfully and heartbreakingly admit we have lost the plot in our own movie.

Whilst that is stark and upsetting, there is something you can do right here and right now. And that is to take command, assume charge and make a pledge to completely live, be and do your Vision in its fullest sense, your wonderfully amazing uncharted version. Visions by default don't all have to be massive, long or epic for they truly come in all variants and dimensions. It has to be said that any Vision when realized is outstanding and an accomplishment to be proud of already.

We are but one big Diamond and each of us is shining our little edge. Some choose the jagged edge, others may opt for smooth, some desire a vast slab and others resonate with the petite spot in the corner. That is the beauty of us; our wondrous diversity, our limitless ideas and humorous idiosyncrasies; we literally cover all the facets of the giant Universal mirror. We reflect within and without and together we can co-create that in the expression of however we choose; be it love and peace or hate and war, we get to decide, we are the difference in the everyday.

In the evolution of your Vision, you are whole heartedly free to unequivocally dream; to soul search and be inspired by others, to read imagination driven novels or gripping biographies, to peruse enlightening quotations. Maybe watch educating documentaries or you might visit faraway lands for cultural understanding or absolutely any manner which allows your personal freedom to take flight within your heart, soul and mind. For some people it is just there and they know it from a very young age as we are all born perfect with our gifts and Vision inside, whilst for others, it maybe that it has been lost, forgotten or covered over by a large layer of dust created by living out of their own alignment.

Regardless of where you find yours, all you need to remember is that your particular journey with its events and circumstances will be the ones that are right for you this time, irrespective of whether we currently agree or can 'see' the gifts, lessons and wisdom they contain. Take solace in the fact that it is in there within you somewhere and with a little digging and pruning in your minds garden it will be there waiting to be discovered and brought to life.

"The whole point of being alive is to evolve into the complete person you were intended to be." Oprah Winfrey

A Vision can contain whatever it needs to for you. Realistic has no home in it and it doesn't need to look like your friends or even be completely detailed to begin with. It just needs to light the first flicker of the flame; it needs to set you alight with magic, wonder and excitement and, mostly likely, it will come with some fears too. You might not have a clue how you would even begin such a thing or maybe even have the slightest idea how you would achieve it but that is no matter either. And if you told someone once maybe they told you it was impossible or you'd never be able to do whatever it might be; they'd be wrong. Very wrong. The golden rule of Visions is that they are not here yet, you cannot hold them in your hand, they surf the intangible world of delectable dreams, ideas and aspirations. And no one has the right to ever, stand on, step on or snuff out another person's Vision. So just accept that yours might not be to the liking or comprehension of another and let that slide on by, this tells you that they have not engaged themselves deeply enough in the task of their own Vision and that yours must simply be stunning if it's getting that much attention!

We'll take a moment to stop here and acknowledge fears for they do exist within our minds. This is the first clue that they inhabit our inner world and in some cases live with our permission. That means you or someone else put it there which in turn means you alone or with some help can take it out again and replace it with something far better serving. But before you do, let's explore the benefit of understanding our fears or more specifically the inability to act in the face of them. It is flagging something to you, so first you need to decide; is this helpful? Is there a gem of wisdom in it? If there is, take it out and keep it and then continue on to remove the fear. If it is completely incomprehensible, discuss it with someone you trust or someone that can help you. If it comes under the bracket of mild human fears such as those butterflies or slight nerves, for example, you were about to perform, speak or do something in public, then whilst you don't want to be completely overcome by them, equally a small amount of nerves is a useful human emotion. You are alive and that cocktail of excitement, trepidation and the tingle of nerves will boost your adrenalin and get you fired up to live your very best. There lies the gulf between establishing fears that will suppress your Vision and nerves that will help you live it, or maybe more precisely will be there for the journey but keep you beautifully connected with your Divine human centre.

If you have no emotive connection to your Vision, then it would be hard to see it coming alive and real in the world. The emotional language of human kind is the only one that is read and listened to within our Universe. A good rule is to monitor everything in your Vision based on the emotion scale. If it's not hitting those high 10's (if you were counting 1 as low and 10 as high) then it clearly isn't moving you. And if it's not inspiring you then it won't anyone else either.

Be mindful also when crafting your Vision that whilst it is born from your Soul it isn't necessarily just for you to put it in to action. It will more than likely require the help, guidance, assistance, feedback and tweaking of many people and over a long period of time. Sometimes it will be a solo stance for your Vision to live and other times it will entwine with others into a beautiful occasion of interdependence. Each has its place and our aim is to artfully know when to let it out and when to hold it in. These interludes will fluctuate like a leaf on the breeze and you are here to learn the art of skilfully guiding and wielding the Vision throughout all of its many stages and layers.

"If every man would help his neighbour, no man would be without help." Bruce Lee

Our ability to see interdependence as a strength and something that boosts and bolsters and not as a weakness that dissipates your natural character will surely fuel your momentum. Experiences in life will likely meet tough challenges along the journey but like anything worth having you've got to stick with it, go through it and emerge as a bright new butterfly on the other side.

The starting place of all great Visions begins Within, the calm centre of Self, your aligned temporal planes unified with the greater holistic realms of Soul and Spirit. To find your greatest Vision start with your favourite space, ink and paper and allow the serenity of the moment to flow through you. Meditate before and after and find the melding of what you think, what you think you know and what is possible in the cosmos for you to tap in to. Let one idea, permeate into another and don't stifle or suppress your Vision, let it organically come to life. Also don't judge if you later change your mind, or want to erase certain details as you have come up with something else and then just let it all flow through and around. A Vision is a majestic piece of art, your life's art, so apply copious amounts of unconditional love and see just where it takes you.

Amble and ponder for as long as it takes for this Vision of your life should not be rushed. Be mindful that the more you put in to your Vision the more that will emerge from it when it takes shape; so poignantly add those intricate details, the enigmatic and intense colour, glorious depth of field, a singing soulful life and decadent vibrancy so as inflate it, the higher it will fly.

It is a foregone conclusion that take flight it will, as what you set in motion, think of and do in complete unison with the Universe's energies will most certainly unfold a most exciting journey and you will be  helped, guided and sent signs that will help you see it all the way through. The end may be a surprise, a stop off on the way to a revised Vision or even completely just how you imagined it. Whatever it may bring, you can be sure that an aligned and on purpose soul led Vision is the sure to be the most heartfelt and sensational yet.

What will be on the vista of your Vision mountain? ...
