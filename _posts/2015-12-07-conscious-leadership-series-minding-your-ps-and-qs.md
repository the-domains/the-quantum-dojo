# Conscious Leadership Series - Minding your P's & Q's 

Ultimately, most people want to make a difference, don't you? 

If
you have the choice with whatever role you are in, it might be a safe 
bet to say that you'd like to bring your very best contribution, add 
something more than what was there to begin with and if at all possible 
create some happiness or give a great experience for someone somewhere.

Staying
with that premise and surveying the lands of the business world, 
change, innovation and evolution are key themes it could well seem and 
yet some aspects are more slower to embrace change or indeed it just 
maybe that the right questions are being asked.  
When we consider 
conscious leadership or social change models it can be perceived as only
focusing on such issues such as the environment, sustainability, 
working conditions, fairer trading and more.   
However the magic 
is in the blending of the two, it's about knowing what works, or at 
least what did work, and adapting and evolving our entrepreneurial 
efforts and businesses to encompass a new world that has both emerged 
and will continue to re-shape. Driven by not only the break neck speed 
of technology, quantum computing and galactic missions but also born out
of a very real need to stop and think and survey the land. The horizon 
we have co-created and currently reside in.   
And further, if we 
do not like it, or wish for something more sophisticated yet 
compassionate, then we are the ones solely responsible for those 
creative strategies, implementation and continued development.  
For
conscious business and indeed leadership, The Magic 3 come in the form 
of the triple bottom line - people, planet and profit. The whole system 
of the organism is affected which can be viewed  in Feng Shui terms, as 
creating constructive cycles or destructive ones. We get to choose. And 
that brings will it the most extraordinary and exciting possibilities 
because we get to re-design the wheel.   
You can take each 
component and aspect and work through the models and creative thinking 
and apply new strategies and ideals that convey the power of the whole; 
being the impact and positive influence of the people involved both 
internally and externally from the business and how that in turn affects
our planet and thus ensuring we are working in the most harmonious of 
ways for all.  
Once each element of the conscious pie has been 
considered, shaped, created and delivered we are finding more and more 
this positive state of flow, the core chi of the business, will 
naturally yield higher profits and results. Whilst that may on first 
glance, appear to be a very general and sweeping statement, it is stated
based on the solid back bone and foundation of solid business decision 
making and is not to be taken lightly or dismissed as woolly or wishful 
thinking.  
A recent article in the American Express business forum
discusses Whole Foods Founder's John Mackay's book on Conscious 
Capitalism and the model that is the blue print of their business, 
alongside smaller businesses and how the current generation of 
entrepreneurs are co-creating this change in landscape to facilitate our
want, need and desire to do something far more and greater, audacious 
and evolved than just working for working's sake or even for generating 
profit with no larger or grander purpose to it.  
Jeff Klein states
in his book It's Just Good Business: The Emergence of Conscious 
Capitalism & the Practice of Working for Good.  "People typically 
start businesses---whether it's a mom-and-pop grocery or a high-tech 
company---because they're motivated by an idea and a passion to create 
something they want to share with others. Human beings are motivated 
more by meaning and purpose than by money."  
I would invite us all
as conscious leaders of our own destinies and businesses to review that
what we do and how we do it and positively encourage the asking of new,
pressing and engaging questions and the solid inclusion of the triple 
bottom line as the new standard. From new or renewed perspectives, 
brighter outcomes can be sorted, creativity can work it's wonder and we 
might just be on a brink of that conscious leadership revolution because
we decided it's time was right now. 

What single aspect could you inspire change with today?
